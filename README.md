# completion-handler-turorial
This is a tutorial to make completion handlers more approachable using Udacity oauth to demonstrate how completion handlers
assist updates on the user interface or anything else that would need to happen during the asynchronous request at a specific
time... Feel free to submit a pr if you have anything to add. 

1) Sign in with Udacity using the textfields or just set the username and password in the networking class to default values
  so you don't need to type it in everytime

2) MAKE SURE TO MESS WITH THE COMPLETION HANDLERS- this will teach you about them and the best way to learn is screw with stuff ðŸ˜œ

3) click `done` to dismiss the keyboard and look at the result


Making this taught me about completion handlers and how to make sure all updates from the asynchronous request happen on time
